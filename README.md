# Fake News Detector

## Overview
The Fake-and-Real-News-Dataset provides a curated collection of news articles labeled as either "Fake" or "Real" to aid in the development and evaluation of fake news detection models. This dataset is designed to support machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) tasks focused on distinguishing between genuine and deceptive news content.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is composed of two separate Excel files:

Fake.xlsx: Contains news articles which are "Fake."
Real.xlsx: Contains news articles which are "Real."

These files have been combined into a single dataset for comprehensive analysis and model testing.
